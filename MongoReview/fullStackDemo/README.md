Jacob's process for making an app:
- get idea
- map out what you will need in the back end: authentication, models, endpoints, etc.
- make server.js structure
- authentication
	- google client id: google developers console
	- apis with auth > credentials - client id & client secret
	- oath login-scopes
- express, passport, GoogleStragety.OAuth2Strategy, body-parser, session
- serializer/deserializer
- Mongoose & mongo. mongoURI, Mongoose.connect, Mongoose.connection.once, etc. 27017
- save a user with authenticaton
	- create a controller to update or create user every time you log in with google. Think about it for a sec.
